# Margin and Padding practice

For this first exercise, simply edit the `style.css` file so that the divs look like the image below. Only edit the CSS where instructed in the file.  You should only have to change the values of the margin and padding for this exercise. You should not have to add or remove properties in the CSS, or touch the HTML.

### Self-check

Use this section to check your work. On _these_ projects, your goal isn't to attain 100% pixel perfection, but to use the tools you've learned to get relatively close to the desired output.

- Div One and Div Three have 32px between their text and border.
  
  Yep, changed the padding of both div elements so that padding was set to 32px.
- Div One has 12px between it and any other element on the page.
  
  Yep, added 12px of margin to div one. Margin controls the spacing between elements.
- There is a 48px gap between Div Two and Div Three.
  
  Due to the way margin collapsing works, only had to add margin-bottom to div two.  This one step added the 48px gap needed.
- Div Three is aligned to the right.
  
  Changed the value of the margin-left to 330px to achieve the needed affect.
- Div Three's alignment is achieved using `margin` (and not float, flexbox, etc.).
  
  Nope, did not make use of floats or flex boxes as I have not learned about them at this point.
